On June 20th, 2025, a major landslide occurred in the Himachal Pradesh region of northern India. The disaster struck near the town of Manali, where a hillside gave way after several days of continuous rain.

Local authorities reported that more than 75 people were affected, with rescue operations led by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Several homes were destroyed and parts of the National Highway 3 were completely blocked.

Eyewitnesses described the scene as chaotic, with mud and debris rushing down the slopes. Helicopters were dispatched from Chandigarh to assist in search-and-rescue efforts.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences and assured support for the victims. Relief camps have been set up in nearby villages, and temporary shelters are being provided.

Environmental experts say that unregulated construction and deforestation in the region may have worsened the situation. They are calling for long-term solutions to prevent such disasters in the future.
